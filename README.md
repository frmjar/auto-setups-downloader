# auto-setups-downloader
A nodejs application to automatically download all Pure Driving School setups without having to do it manually one by one.

## How to use
It is very simple to use. Enter the username and password you use to log in to Pure Driving School in utils/constantes or create an .env file in the root directory. In that same file, also add the desired download address.

To compile the project, simply do ``npm install``.
Then just run ``node src/main.js`` and all available Pure Driving School setups will be downloaded.
